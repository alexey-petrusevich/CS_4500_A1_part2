Object class is implemented by Array 

We created a few different example functions that could be utilized within our class 
We started off with this list and eventually kept adding as we saw fit 
   * - Number of elements (length());
	 * - elementAt(index)
	 * - indexOf(Element);
	 * - replace(index, element);
	 * - insert(index, element);
	 * - remove(index) - removed an element at index, and shift remaining element to the left
	 * - split(index) - splits the array into two different index
	 * - isEmpty()
   * - equalArray() - compares two arrays and checks for equality

None of the functions were written out, but the general outline makes it easier for us to write them as required.
